# PCSX Two Player Controller Config

This repo contains the following files:
* init.sh : runs xbox drivers for two controllesr
* xbox.cfg : xboxdrv config for controller 1
* ps3.cfg : xboxdrv config for controller 2
* pcsx.cfg : control map for pcsx reloaded

The controller configs are not xbox/ps3 specific, but will only work with controllers recognized by xboxdrv. These configurations have not been tested and only run on a raspberry pi
